# Basic
1. Loaded shapefiles need to go to their respective tileset if specified, that
or to the current active tileset.

2. Download pngs when on google/landsat layer 

3. Make box/point drawing impossible outside of tileset boundries.

4. Create shell tool for generating tilesets from geotifs (not client side)

5. Allow client to edit background layer (hardcoded currently)

6. Allow for metadata to be added on markers

?. Make code look less like shit (in progress)

#Extended
1. Draw arbitrary polygons as bounding boxes, users cannot draw points outside
of these boundries

2. Allow for 'do work' framework i.e given set of polygons, fill region with
points
